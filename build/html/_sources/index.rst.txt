Welcome to the documentation for SAMS pipeline
==============================================

SAMS Pipeline: Introduction
===========================

This semi-automatic mandible segmentation (SAMS) pipeline was developed by the `Vocal Tract Development Lab <http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/vocal/>`_ for the purpose of generating 3D mandible/jaw objects from head and neck multi-detector Computed Tomography(MDCT) images. The purpose of this pipeline is to accelerate the process of consistently segmenting large number of 3D mandibles needed for analysis to quantify morpholoic changes of the mandible across the first two decades of life. This pipeline is semi-automatic with the initial(pre-processing) and final(post-processing) steps requiring manual interventions.

This document will provides a background and walkthrough of the pipeline.
