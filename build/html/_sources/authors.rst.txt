The semi-automatic mandible segmentation (SAMS) pipeline is developed from a project started in the `Vocal Tract Development Lab <http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/vocal>`_, Waisman Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2013.
This pipeline is a culmination of efforts of VTLab members who have worked on this project in chronological order: `Nagesh Adluru <http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/~adluru>`_, Simon Lank, Benjamin M. Doherty and Ying Ji Chuang.

This project is thoroughly supervised by the VTLab Director `Dr. Houri K. Vorperian <http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/pi-Vorperian-Houri.htm>`_ and with guidance from `Dr. Moo K. Chung <http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~mchung>`_.
