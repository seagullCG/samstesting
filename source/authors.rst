The semi-automatic mandible segmentation (SAMS) pipeline is developed from a project started in the Vocal Tract Development Lab in 2013.
This pipeline is a culmination of efforts of VTLab members who have worked on this project: Nagesh Adluru, Simon Lank, Benjamin M. Doherty and Ying Ji Chuang (in chronological order).

This project is thoroughly supervised by the VTLab Director Dr. Houri K. Vorperian and with guidance from Dr. Moo K. Chung.
